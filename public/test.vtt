00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.430
Join us for a day in the life where we help teach a class at Harvard Law School,

1
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.510
which you probably don't know because they really modest about it is

2
00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:06.840
where we went to law school before our morning flight to Boston.

3
00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:09.210
We grab a nice breakfast from the Delta lounge and Macklin

4
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.760
talks about Delta not responding to his D MS for sponsorship.

5
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.510
We then get to campus with enough time to take a walk through memory lane.

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.609
I threw up here

7
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.129
including the exact seats where we met for the first time Macklin asks

8
00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:21.799
if we can role play our first interaction for old time's sake.

9
00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:23.120
And I begrudgingly agree.

10
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.170
Are you charging me with a crime

11
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.729
because you're the prosecutor? Finally, the class starts and students file in.

12
00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.409
It's the last day of a winter course on leadership fundamentals.

13
00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:34.619
The professor plays one of our videos and then we lecture a

14
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.290
bit on the intersection of the no one cares about that.

15
00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:38.290
Next, we go to lunch with a professor and a few students.

16
00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:40.610
We hear rumors that there was a waitlist to join us.

17
00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:43.849
Macklin talks about the important aspects of life after you graduate from Harvard,

18
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.490
like how high the membership fees for the Illuminati have become.
